        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>In this task, you will be asked to read a Reddit post and annotate whether it would be empowering to the reader (the person or group of people reading the post).</p>
        <p>With each post, you will also see some accompanying contextual information, such as the reader’s response, the subreddit, and the gender of the poster and/or reader. Please remember that you’ll be annotating the original post, not the response. The response is shown only because it may provide useful context.</p>
        <p>You’ll then rate how empowering or disempowering the post is, on a scale with “empowering” on one end, “neutral” in the middle, and “disempowering” on the other (Q1). You’ll also be asked to select which reasons the post would empower or disempower the reader (Q2).</p>
        <p>Finally, you’ll be asked whether the poster and reader agree / share a similar perspective, or if they disagree / have opposing perspectives (Q3).</p>
        <h1>Definition of Empowering, Disempowering, Neutral</h1>
        <p><b>Empowering</b>: A post is empowering if it supports the reader’s rights, choices, self-fulfillment, or self-esteem. Empowering posts imply one or more of the following things about the reader, whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
        <p><b>Disempowering</b>: A post is disempowering if it actively goes against the empowerment of the reader. This can mean denying their right to make choices, assuming they are ignorant, putting words in their mouth, imposing a point of view, drawing conclusions about their character.</p>
        <p><b>Neutral</b>: A post is neutral if it does not contain any implications about the reader’s capability, power, etc. Text that only describes situations or expresses an opinion about an external topic is usually neutral. </p>

        <h1>Empowerment/Disempowerment Reasons</h1>
        <p>If you labeled a post as empowering or disempowering, select all reasons that explain why you think it is empowering/disempowering: </p>

        </ol>
        
        <h1>Definition of Agreement of Poster and Reader</h1>
        <p>For each poster and reader, we want to know whether they agree or disagree with each other on the topic of discussion.</p>
        <p><b>Agree</b>: poster and reader support the same stance / point of view on the topic, whether they are talking about politics, sports teams, music preferences, or any other topic that they could take sides on. </p>
        <p><b>Disagree</b>: they take opposing sides. </p>
        <p><b>Neutral</b>: If the topic is not debatable (e.g. facts about the weather today) and / or there’s no indication that the poster and reader have any stance on the topic.</p>
